# 2048
A javascript beginer's 2048 game.
Use direction keys to squeeze blocks from different directions. The blocks with same numbers crash together and become a double-number block. It genereates a new number block of 2 or 4 every turn.
If you create a 2048 block, you win. If the blocks fill up all the space, the game OVER!
